## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for looking into contributing to Cloud-J! Cloud-J is an open-source model that relies on contributions from community members. Whether you are just starting out or are a longtime user, you are a valued member of the community, and we want you to feel empowered to contribute.

#### We use GitHub
We use GitHub to host the Cloud-J source code, to track issues, user questions, and feature requests, and to accept pull requests: [https://github.com/geoschem/Cloud-J](https://github.com/geoschem/cloud-j). Please help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

#### How to submit changes
We request that all code submissions be provided through pull requests. As the author you are responsible for:
- Testing your changes
- Updating the user documentation (if applicable)
- Supporting issues and questions related to your changes in the near-term

#### Coding conventions
The Cloud-J codebase pre-dates hosting on GitHub and includes contributions from many people and multiple organizations. Therefore, some inconsistent conventions are inevitable, but we ask that you do your best to be consistent with conventions you see in the code.

#### How to request an enhancement
We accept feature requests through issues on GitHub. To request a new feature, [open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/cloud-j/issues/new/choose) and select the feature request template. Please include all the information that might be relevant, including the motivation for the feature.
