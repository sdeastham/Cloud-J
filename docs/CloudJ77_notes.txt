Cloud-J version 7.7 notes (Feb 2020, Prather)

Small cleanup from version 7.6 (see notes below)
    some typos and non-std characters removed

!    Variables in calling sequence expanded to get diagnotics out.
!   'fjx_cmn_mod.f90' modified slightly to include variables for running SJ w/LLNL & CLIRAD
!     v7.7  (02/2020) Final synch with Solar-J v7.7
!        Corrects problem with MAX-RAN that was caused by MAX-COR fixes
!        New calling sequence of FPs, added OD18
!   'cld_sub_mod.f90' for Cloud-J v7.7 (02/2020) - last change = fixes for MAXRAN
!---revised in v7.7 (02/2020) fixed MAX-RAN (#0 & #3) set CLDCOR=0 if need be
!      SUBROUTINE ICA_DIRECT -- not used, finally removed in v7.7

Cloud-J version v7.6c notes (Jul 2019, Prather)

The last published version of Cloud-J was v7.3c (see Prather, 2015 GMD)
Updates with minor fixes have been released: 7.3d, 7.3e, 7.4d, see
    ftp site:  ftp://128.200.14.8/public/prather/Fast-J_&_Cloud-J

This new version 7.6c goes along with the publication of the paper:
    A round Earth for climate models, Prather & Hsu, PNAS, 2019.
Cloud-J and Solar-J have many overlapping data sets and subroutines,
    but Solar-J is more complex and has special needs.

Major updates, many described in the 2019 publication include:
    Spherical hydrostatic corrections for mass and geometry (new option)
    Corrected calc of deposition of direct beam (FLXD) so that scattered
        flux is now conserved to 2/e6, and the TOTAL incident is correct
    A refractive ray-tracing code SPHERE1R is available, and a new cleaner
         algorithm for SPHERE1N (straight rays) is included.  Also a
         flat-Earth version SPHERE1F is available.
    Major re-coding of the Feautrier lower boundary conditions to allow for
         angle-dependent albedos, specifically the ALBEDO is now specified
         for each wavelength at the 4 quad angles AND for the incident SZA.
    New Ocean Surface Albedo (OSA) module depends on angle, wind, chlorophyl
         based on Seferian++ code; XWRC corrected for <400 nm from 0 to 0.2
    New simpler way of interpolating TAU and F for inserted cloud layers
    Dropped adding mid-layer odd-points for J's to cut cost.
    All the data tables needed to iniitalize are in a subdirectory /tables

Three sample standalone drivers show: a range of solar zenith angles for
cloudy vs clear, the effect of stratospheric (including GeoMIP) aerosols,
and the range of different cloud-overlap parameterizations.

Note:  the ACLIM_FJX module in fjx_sub_mod.f90 had to be corrected for Solar-J
to do a smooth interpolation with latitude.  This corrected version is included
here as fjx_sub_mod-corr.f90. It should replace the original version, but
the standalone reference cases have NOT been redone, and the corrected
version shifts the atmospheric profiles in T and O3.
