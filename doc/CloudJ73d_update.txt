Cloud-J version 7.3d Notes    (the 'x' means that this fix is only to a small section)
              only one module is given, use v7.3c for the others.
Michael Prather 12 Jan 2016

Only the module "cld_sub_mod.f90" was changed, and only to ensure that
the correlated max-overlap groups began from the bottom of layer 1.

N.B.  Our CTM suffered segmentation faults (only in OpenMP mode) without this fix.
      There is no change in the test files using the 640 tropical atmospheres.
.

! v 7.3d  minor change in sub ICA_NR() with ZZZ(L) ==> ZZZ(L)-ZZZ(1) for Zbin categories
!             if (ZZZ(L)-ZZZ(1) .lt. Zbin(N)) then


ALSO

version 7.3d FJX_spec.dat has changes in XO3 and QO1D   (Michael Prather Feb 2016)
        These used different Temperature tables based on the different ranges
        of data (X & Q) in JPL-2010.  There was also an historical QO1D value
        that was accidentally (and incorrectly) propagated.

        Now these are clearly traceable to the JPL-2010 tables

        Impact:  J-O3(total) is -1% over most of atmosphere
                 J-O3(O1D)   os +2% (0-3 km) and +4% (6-20 km).
